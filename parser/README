*   This Zip contains .c and .h files that when compiled, create a Vcard Library in c. The goal of this library is for 
*   programmers to parse Vcard data and store it in a VCARD struct object.
*
*   To compile the program, you can:
*   1. Make (or) Make all   ::  This compiles and creates the library for parser and the list.
*   2. Make parser          ::  This compiles just the parser library.
*   3. Make list            ::  This compiles just he list library.
*   4. Make clean           ::  This removes all the created files in the bin folder.
*
*   Please make sure when entering the filename, that it's a valid format. Only .vcard and .vcf formats
*   can be used. Also, this library can only parse VERSION:4.0 of the vcard standard. 
*
*   For futher requirments read the vcard official documents.
